# Createing a struct 

```monobridge
public struct Point:
	number<i32> X
	number<i32> Y
```

Structs are readonly value types that can be used to group related data.

To make a struct mutable, you can use the `mutable` keyword:
```monobridge
public mutable struct Point:
	number<i32> X
	number<i32> Y

```

To create a new instance of a struct, you can use the new keyword:
```monobridge
// named properties
var point = new Point():
    X : 10
    Y : 20

// unnamed properties (by order)
var point = new Point(10, 20)

// a mix of named and unnamed properties
var point = new Point(10):
    Y : 20;
```

To get the value of a property
```monobridge
var x = point.X
var y = point.Y

logInfo($"x: {x}, y: {y}")

```

## Differents between c# and monobridge

Structures in MonoBridge might not translate as fully-fledged structs. The standard implementation translates it as a sealed class:
```csharp
public sealed class Point : IEquatable<Point>
{
    public required int X { get; init; } 
    public required int Y { get; init; }

    public bool Equals(Point? other)
    {
        if (other is null)
            return false;

        if (ReferenceEquals(this, other))
            return true;

        return X == other.X && Y == other.Y;
    }

    public override bool Equals(object? obj)
    {
        if (obj is Point other)
        {
            return Equals(other);
        }

        return false;
    }

    public override int GetHashCode()
    {
        return HashCode.Combine(X, Y);
    }

    public static bool operator ==(Point? left, Point? right)
    {
        if (left is null)
            return right is null;

        return left.Equals(right);
    }

    public static bool operator !=(Point? left, Point? right)
    {
        return !(left == right);
    }
}
```

To treat it as a struct, you need to annotate it as follows:
```monobridge
[TypeRequest(AllocationRequest=AllocationType.InStack)]
public struct Point
{
    int X;
    int Y;
}
```
This will generate a struct in the target language:
```csharp
public readonly struct Point
{
	public readonly int X { get; }
	public readonly int Y { get; }

	public Point(int x, int y)
	{
		X = x;
		Y = y;
	}

    public bool Equals(Point other)
    {
        return X == other.X && Y == other.Y;
    }

    public override bool Equals(object? obj)
    {
        if (obj is Point other)
        {
            return Equals(other);
        }

        return false;
    }

    public override int GetHashCode()
    {
        return HashCode.Combine(X, Y);
    }

    public static bool operator ==(Point left, Point right)
    {
        return left.Equals(right);
    }

    public static bool operator !=(Point left, Point right)
    {
        return !(left == right);
    }
}
```
If an attribute ends with "Request," it signifies that it is only a desired value, not a mandatory one. Therefore, you should design your algorithms in such a way that they do not rely on this behavior.

An important point is that the behavior of the compiler fully depends on the provider. The language is not meant to function as a standalone, so you should verify how the language behaves with your specific provider.
