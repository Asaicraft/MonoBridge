# Introduction to MonoBridge

## What is MonoBridge?

MonoBridge is designed as a cross-platform plugin language, allowing developers to access all "symbols"  and the complete Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for compilation into the desired target language. It functions more as an auxiliary language for your project rather than a standalone full-fledged language.

## Differences between MonoBridge and Haxe

While both MonoBridge and Haxe are designed as cross-platform languages that allow developers to compile code into multiple target languages, there are key differences between them:

1. **Syntax Similarity to C#**:  
   The most notable difference is that MonoBridge closely resembles C# in its syntax, making it familiar to developers who work with C#. This similarity is intended to ease the learning curve for C# developers when using MonoBridge.

2. **Pythonic Syntax**:  
   MonoBridge adopts a more "pythonic" style compared to Haxe. In MonoBridge, the syntax is simplified by the absence of curly braces `{}` commonly used in languages like C#. Instead, it uses indentation and a cleaner structure, similar to Python, which makes the code more readable and concise.

3. **Purpose and Focus**:  
   While Haxe is a fully-featured programming language that supports various platforms for building a wide range of applications, MonoBridge is intended specifically as an auxiliary language for plugin development within existing projects. Its primary function is to provide access to symbols and ASTs for plugin creation rather than serving as a general-purpose language.
