# Logging

By default, log messages are sent to the console, but you can modify logging behavior by changing the log level and output destination.

## Log Levels

You can use different log levels to indicate the severity of a message.

```monobridge
logTrace("This is a trace message")
logDebug("This is a debug message")
logInfo("This is an info message")
logWarn("This is a warning message")
logError("This is an error message")
logFatal("This is a fatal message")
```

You can set the minimum log level in the project file:

```xml

<Logging>
	<LogLevel>
		<Default>Information</Default>
	</LogLevel>
</Logging>

```

Or in the code:

```monobridge
Logger.DefaultMinimumLevel = LogLevel.Information
```

## Log Output

By default, log messages are written to the console. You can change the output destination by setting a custom logger factory:

```monobridge
Logger.LoggerFactory = new FileLoggerFactory("log.txt")
```

Or you can add providers to the logger factory:

```monobridge
Logger.LoggerFactory.AddProvider(new ConsoleLoggerProvider())
```

## Log Categories

You can add categories to log messages for more detailed filtering:

```monobridge
logInfo("This is an info message", categoryName: "CategoryName")
```

Or use generic log methods to set the category by type:

```monobridge
logInfo<CategoryName>("This is an info message")
```

By default, the log category is set by the current scope:

```monobridge
void Hi():
    logInfo("Hi")
    // Equivalent to:
    logInfo("Hi", categoryName: "Hi")

logInfo("Hello")
// Equivalent to:
logInfo<Program>("Hello")

```

### Setting Minimum Log Level by Category

You can set a minimum log level for specific categories:

```monobridge

Logger.SetCategoryMinimumLevel("CategoryName*", LogLevel.Warning)
// All log messages with a category starting with "CategoryName" will only be logged if they are at the Warning level or higher
```

### Creating a Custom Logger

You can create a custom logger by defining a log method with a specific signature and adding it to the logger factory:

```monobridge
void Log(string message, LogLevel logLevel, string categoryName, dic<string, any> properties):
    pass

Logger.LoggerFactory.AddProvider(Log)
```
