# Create first program

To create a new first program, you can use the following command, it's simular to the `dotnet new console` command.

```cmd
monotoo new -n MyFirstProgram
```

This command will create a new first program with the name `MyFirstProgram` in the current directory.

The generated program will have the following structure:

```plaintext
|-- MyFirstProgram
	|-- MyFirstProgram.monobridgeproj
	|-- Program.monobridge
```

The `MyFirstProgram.monobridgeproj` file is the project file for the first program, and the `Program.monobridge` file is the main file for the program.

The `MyFirstProgram.monobridgeproj` file contains the following code:

```xml
<Project Sdk="MockSdk">

	<PropertyGroup>
		<!-- If you create package replace Runnabel to Package -->
		<ProjectType>Runnabel</ProjectType>
		<!-- Entry point for you project -->
		<EntryPoint>Program.monobridge</EntryPoint>
	</PropertyGroup>

	<Logging>
		<LogLevel>
			<Default>Information</Default>
		</LogLevel>
	</Logging>


</Project>
```

The `Program.monobridge`  file contains the following code:

```monobridge

logInfo<Program>("Hello world!")

```

## How to create variables

You can create var as imlicit or explicit type:

```monobridge

number x = 10

# Or implicit type

var x = 10

```

All variables immutable by default:

```monobridge

# Immutable variable
var x = 10

x = 11 # Error 

# Mutable  variable
mut var y = 12;

y = 11.33 # Ok

```

## Default types

1. `strng` - nothing to tell. Just write string in `"some string"`. Write in double quoutes.
2. `char` - simple char, Just write char in `'c'`. Write in quote.
3. `number` - it's number.
4. `bool` - logical value
5. `[]` - array
6. `dic<TKey, TValue>` - dictionray
7. `any` - any type

###  number

`number` is type which converted by default to double. You can use type request to  number, but remember, it's just requst,  it signifies that it is only a desired value, not a mandatory one

```monobridge

number<i64> long = 12345678910
number<i32> int = 123456
number<i16> short = 1234
number<i8> byte = 128

number<f128> decimal = 123456789.123456789
number<f64> double = 123.456789101112
number<f32> float = 123.45678910
number<f16> half  = 123.45678
number<f8> minifloat = 123.45 

```

But remember it's just request, not a mandatory one

### dic

```monobridge

var dictionary = new dic<number, string>():
	132: "test"
	10: "hello"

logInfo<Program>(dictionary[132])

dictionary[333] = "another"

logInfo<Program>(dictionary[132])

```

### any

`any` is type which can be any type. It's like `object` in C#.

```monobridge

any x = 10

logInfo<Program>(x)

```
